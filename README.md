## The mindset: What do we expect from you in this hackathon?

We expect you to `have FUN`, `LEARN` something new and to `respect the rest of the hackers` using our [Code of Conduct](https://hackupc.com/code_conduct). That's all, we don't have any other expectations, each of you will have different goals during the weekend, and we love that! üòç

We all know that winning is hard, and it should not be your first focus because you will put so much pressure on yourself and your team, that it's not gonna be fun! Instead, see this hackathon as a great learning opportunity and focus on the process of building some cool rather than the prizes. HackUPC offers you an incredible opportunity for making new friends, working with other folks that can teach you things, and build a project you can brag about or use for applying to tech companies.

Jorge Ferreiro in his [post](https://www.ferreiro.me/blog/part-1-the-definitive-guide-to-making-the-most-of-college-tech-hackathons#the-3-ws) come up with a framework called _The 3ws_. Jorge suggests to make a list answering the following questions:

* üìö **What do you want to learn?** A new UI libraries (like Vue.js, React), a new programming language (JavaScript, Python, Ruby, Rust, Elixir, Go), how to use a particular API (Twilio, AWS, etc), hardware (Arduino), Virtual Reality, Voice Recognition, TensorFlow‚Ä¶
* üó£Ô∏è **What do you want to improve?** Public speaking, team leadership, communication‚Ä¶
* üëã **Who do you want to meet?** Companies to get tech internships, mentors to get coaching or help, other hackers to keep expanding your network‚Ä¶

## The team: Go hunting!

Hacking alone is boring! In HackUPC we allow teams up to 4 people or work alone. We strongly recommend you to fill your team with people that complement you. The most diverse and complete team, the better! Find people that you want to work with and that you can learn and have fun with.

### How to find people?

*Brainstorming session:* In the first few hours of the event, we run a `Team Building` action where each of you share your ideas, and team up! This is a wonderful opportunity to connect with other hackers and break the ice. Even if you have a team an idea, just drop by and see what's going on. You can get inspiration, or even new team members.

*On Slack*: Days before the hackathon we have enabled our Slack, a cool tool to chat and connect with other hackers. We strongly suggest you to use Slack days before, and start talking with people. 

*On Facebook groups*: Sometimes we create Facebook groups to help people connect to each other. Feel free to drop by and say hi.

### How to Introduce yourself

We think is helpful if you introduce yourself: who you are, where you come from, what are your skillsets and what are you looking for. If

Example 1: First time hackathon

```
Hi, I'm Arnorld! I'm from Japan, currently studing Computer Science. I've some basic knowledge on Javascript, and I've learned some Java in my college. It's my first time in a hackathon, and I'm really excited to find a great team of people to learn from, and have fun with. I'm very passionate about web development, education, and hacks with a positive impact in the world.

If you wanna team up, ping me!
```

Example 2: Veteran.
```
Hi, I'm Laura! I'm from Spain, studying 3rd year of Data Science. I've attended 4 hackathons, and I'd like to create a project that comines machine learning with Web Development. I've worked with TensorFlow, Apache Spark, and Python. I have a solid experience on Image recognition, and I have worked previoulsy with Amazon AWS.

I'd like to build an application to help blind people to move easily through the city. Feel free to reach out to me, and ask me more questions. I'm also free to change projects if something more cool showup! :)
```

## The idea(s)

Ideally you would start finding the right idea days or weeks before starting the hackathon. While this is not required, this will help you not to waste time the first hours of the hackathon figuring out what you wanna built.

We'd suggest you to start writing down ideas using a shared docs.

We have an amazing team building event that always takes place in the first hours of the event. We really encourage you to attend that event for many reasons:

* üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è You can find those last folks to complete your superb team.
* üí°You can get inspiration from other people's ideas.
* üó£You can start "networking" with other hackers.

## Ideas validation

Do not keep the idea for youself! Spread the knowledge and get insights and help from mentors. Whenver you see someone with the mentors t-shirt, start talking with them! Do not be shy, they are here to help you. Ask them things like: 

## The first hours

Do not start coding right away. First think about your idea and the problem you wanna solve

## The MVCH (minimum viable crap hack): Project Scoping

## The Social Hackathon

## Presentations

Depends on the edition, there will be some rounds of judging. These rounds help us to filter all the hacks, and make a list of top final hacks that will go to the closing ceremony.

### First few rounds

In order to be successful in the first rounds, be passionate about the hack you built and follow this structure:

1) What problem you solved?
2) Demo the hack.
3) Tell them what you learned.

## Why are there sponsors and what can I learn from them?

* **Why are there sponsors?** Sponsors allow us to make this hackathon a free event for college students. Thanks to them we can pay your travel, the yummy food, the swag, the midnight snaks... Without their money we couldn't make it possible, or we couldn't make it a free event.

* **What do sponsors get in return?** Different sponsors have different goals: some of them are looking to find great people to do internships or to join their companies once they finish the university. Others are looking for giving back to the students community, other wanna showcase their technologies, etc... 

* **What can you get from the sponsors?** We think that sponsors can be a good source of learning as well as getting an opportunity to have a tech internship or full time job with them. Most of the sponsors run different challenges, where they give prices. This is a really awesome opportunity to work on their tools, and
